# online-shopping
In this project, we must create a program that simulates an online shopping experience.
• The user should be prompted for their user name and then be told their membership level and current balance.
• The user should be offered a sequence of 5 items to purchase, 1 by 1.
• After each item is displayed, the user must be given the option to purchase the item.
• If the user chooses to purchase the item and they have enough money in their balance to buy it, then they are congratulated and the item’s cost is deducted from their balance
but NOT displayed for them!
• If the user does not have enough money in their balance to purchase the item, then the program crashes and an error message scolds the user for going over budget.
• If the user makes it through the last item without crashing the program, they should be congratulated on completing their number of purchases.

Requirements
1. Your on-line shopping site has three tiers of membership, Gold , Silver and Bronze. Each level provides a different level of discount as follows:
a. Gold : everything is discounted 50%
b. Silver : items $100 or more are discounted by 20% and those less than $100 but $20 or more are $10 off, everything else is regular price.
c. Bronze : items $250 or more are discounted by 10% and items less than $250 are discounted 5%
